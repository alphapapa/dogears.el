#+TITLE: Dogears.el notes

* Ideas

** Use Emacs bookmarks internally

Like Burly, we can use Emacs bookmarks to save and restore places in mode-specific ways, without actually saving them to Emacs bookmarks.

** Tabulated list view

Should be sortable by recency, relevance (e.g. same buffer/file, same directory, same project, same mode, etc.)

** Sidebar history

Maybe just showing the tabulated list view in a side window.  Would be helpful to see a live-updated list of dogeared places.

** Completion

Similar to how Bufler uses prefixed/pathed completion.  I can imagine a format like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (let ((variable value)))  ((defun foo (bar baz b...)  foo.el:47      (Project)
  LINE SUBSTRING            CONTEXT (here, in a defun)  FILENAME:LINE  RELEVANCE
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Hooks, advice, and timers

The global minor mode would use hooks, advice, and a timer to dogear places when the user does certain things.
