/Never lose your place in Emacs again!/

This library automatically and smartly remembers where you've been, in and across buffers, and helps you quickly return to any of those places.  It uses the Emacs bookmarks system internally (but without modifying the ~bookmarks-alist~) to save and restore places with mode-specific functionality.  As usual, it's configurable to suit each user.
