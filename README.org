/Never lose your place in Emacs again!/

This library automatically and smartly remembers where you've been, in and across buffers, and helps you quickly return to any of those places.  It uses the Emacs bookmarks system internally (but without modifying the ~bookmarks-alist~) to save and restore places with mode-specific functionality.  

As usual, it's configurable to suit each user, with regard to how often places are remembered, which ones, and for how long.

It uses standard Emacs completion, so it works with Helm, Ivy, Selectrum, Vertico, etc.  For Helm users, a ~helm-dogears-source~ is also provided in =helm-dogears.el= that can be used with any Helm command.

* Screenshots

This shows the ~dogears-list~ buffer, in which you can browse entries, sort them, etc.

This screenshot shows it while using the theme =doom-solarized-dark=, and the =Line= column shows some source code snippets with highlighting by [[https://github.com/alphapapa/prism.el][prism.el]].
