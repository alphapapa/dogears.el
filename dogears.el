;;; Commentary:

;; This library automatically and smartly remembers where you've been,
;; in and across buffers, and helps you quickly return to any of those
;; places.  It uses the Emacs bookmarks system internally (but without
;; modifying the bookmarks-alist) to save and restore places with
;; mode-specific functionality.
